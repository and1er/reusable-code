# reusable-code
Useful code fragments groupped by languages (each one in its own folder).

Fragments (function as usual) are placed in separate files. 

The most of them are **MWE** (Minimal working examples) demontrating function usage.


# Batch

Windows command line (`cmd.exe`) batch scripts.

Each `.cmd`-file includes the function with the same name as `.cmd`-file and some usage examples.

The function description is placed inside the funcion (not in the top of the file).

To use the function code copy it with all the dependencies (if specified in the function's description) to your batch file.
